UMT-GUI-Program.py is where the code for the program's gui and logic is.

The Configs folder is where the properties of ores, items, machines, and transport items are in.
Is also where the custom machines, ores, items, transports get saved to.

Assets folder is where images, thumbnails, and other needed files are.



Do not mind the mess, and this program being crippled, Im learning how to code in python :D
